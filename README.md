# challenge4

With this project I started with the HTML page adding the basic structure of the elements needed to get the start of the project done.
Next, I setup the css page starting with getting the look that I wanted with color scheme, for anybody wondering I'm a dolphin fan hence the color scheme. 
Then it was time for the hardest part of the assignment the Javascript part which took the longest. Besides setting up the initial array with the questions, the rest was 
a lot of trial and error and fixing code when something didn't work.
Finally, creating a second page for the highscores section to finish the project up.
